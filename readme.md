Hi everyone!

Dissidia is an amazing game and a great pillar for the Final Fantasy community and it needs more love than it had on the PSP.

My brother and I started playing it again on the PSVita recently and that's why I decided to continue retexturing and remastering **ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING**. From textures, tiny pixelated logos to meshes and art.

I'm running it on a Nintendo Switch with the 60fps mod, native resolution set to 3x and nothing else but the textures.

Here's a video of the end result of the background of Story Mode showing the layers on Photoshop, correcting shapes as well as colours and hues:

This is going to be a long process since I have to redraw ao many faces and rewrite most of the text manually, since it doesn't rely on fonts, but a png texture with the words in it.

For upscaling purposes I am using a mix of different models in Stabe Diffusion alongside with Photoshop manual retouching as of Liquifying, layering and altering Hues.

Every one is very welcome to continue to contribute to this amazing thing that is retexturing Dissidia, since Sony has totally abandoned it.

Thank you all and be seeing you here and in _**Eorzea**_!
