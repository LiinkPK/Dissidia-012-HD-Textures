# Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy HD Project

Hi everyone.

Dissidia is an amazing game and a great pillar for the Final Fantasy community and it needs more love than it had on the PSP.

The original game was designed to be viewed on a small 480 x 272 PSP display, which is fine for the time, but low-res and blurry on modern display sizes. The current aim is to replace all textures in the game<sup>1</sup> with new hand-made textures that scale nicely to 1080p.

My brother and I started playing it again on the PSVita recently and that's why I decided to continue retexturing and remastering **ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING**. From textures, tiny pixelated logos to meshes and art.

I'm running it on a Nintendo Switch with the 60fps mod, native resolution set to 3x and nothing else but the textures.

Here's a video of the end result of the background of Story Mode showing the layers on Photoshop, correcting shapes as well as colours and hues:

This is going to be a long process since I have to redraw so many faces and rewrite most of the text manually, since it doesn't rely on fonts but a png texture with the words in it.

For upscaling purposes I am using a mix of different models in Stabe Diffusion alongside with Photoshop manual retouching as of Liquifying, layering and altering Hues, because I sincerely hate just leaving everything to an AI and not doing anything. We all know that actually looks horrible. This needs the love of human touch and this the best game for my first time doing this.

Everyone is very welcome to continue to contribute to this amazing thing that is retexturing Dissidia, since Sony has totally abandoned it.

Thank you all and be seeing you here and in _**Eorzea**_!
